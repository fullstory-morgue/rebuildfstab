.SH NAME
rebuildfstab \- fstab and mountpoint generator
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBrebuildfstab\fR \fI<options>\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
Uses \fBscanpartitions\fR to rebuild all harddisk entries in \fI/etc/fstab\fR
and create mountpoints.
.PP
\fBscanpartitions\fR reads \fI/proc/partitions\fR and tries to guess the
filesystem on each partition for automatic \fI/etc/fstab\fR generation.
.PP
\fBrebuildfstab\fR is intended for initial creation of \fI/etc/fstab\fR in
situations similar to that of a live linux demonstrtation cd where the fstab
file must be generated from scratch. It is not intended for ongoing maintenance
of the fstab file on standard hard disk installations. Use it at your own risk,
it comes without any warranty.
